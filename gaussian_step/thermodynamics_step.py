        my_description["description"] : tuple
            A description of the Thermodynamics step. It must be
            clear to non-experts.

        my_description["group"] : str
            Which group in the menus to put this step. If the group does
            not exist it will be created. Common groups are "Building",
            "Control", "Custom", "Data", and "Simulations".
